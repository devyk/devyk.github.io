Hello, my name is Yaroslav. I am a self proclaimed backend developer who likes the internet, music, and collecting horror movie figures.

# What do you do?
I make websites. More often I develop tools wich solves different ecommerce problems.

# What programming languages do you use?
Trying to make new things using php (exactly with [zf2](https://framework.zend.com/) and [yii2](http://www.yiiframework.com/)). A lot of other related tools, like mysql, redis, sphinx etc., also involved. 

Also, I have some expirience in developing single-page applications using well-known JS frameworks like [reactjs](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [riotjs](http://riotjs.com/).
